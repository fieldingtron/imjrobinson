Isabelle studied at the School of the Louvre, and the Institute of Art and Archeology at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.

Isabelle was Coordinator for [](https://contemplativeoutreachnova.com/)[Contemplative Outreach of Northern Virginia](https://contemplativeoutreachnova.com/)   for 9 years helping  with logistics for contemplative retreats in the area, served for 4 years as Communications Coordinator for[](https://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/) [Contemplative Outreach](https://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/)   National and Communications Manager for [The Center for Christogenesis.](https://christogenesis.org/)

To create her assemblages Isabelle gathers broken objects found randomly on empty streets, sunny beaches or in the depths of the woods, combining them to create new "wholes." By doing so she breaks the boundaries of each object's function and gives them a new identity through their connections to others.

In some ways those new creations are transplants. A foreign element is introduced to mend a broken piece. That foreign agent is itself also broken, and the mend happens when both find each other and connect through their wounds.

Isabelle 's paintings are emotional landscapes which shift with time and place!
